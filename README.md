# Bash 4.3.3
This repo contains several up-to-date pre-compiled bash binaries for Synology DiskStations. The intention is to provide bash without having to install ipkg on your DiskStation (which gives you a legacy version anyway).

# Installation on Synology DiskStations

* SSH into your DiskStation
* Download the script: `wget https://github.com/CutePoisonX/Bash/releases/download/v4.3.3/SynologyBashInstaller.sh`
* Make the script executable: `chmod +x SynologyBashInstaller.sh`
* Execute the script: `./SynologyBashInstaller.sh`
* Follow the instructions to install bash on your DiskStation

# Installation on other systems
Check the current [release](https://github.com/CutePoisonX/Bash/releases) if there is a version for your system available.
